# FORGE - Fabricated Optical Resource for Gigapixel Exploration
This is a machine inspired by the goal of [TRIM](https://github.com/UAA-Robo/tree-ring) and is developed with the intention to image multiple samples using a modified off the shelf 3D printer. This is still heavily under development.

Below is an image created using this project covering a 1.5mm x 3mm area of a tree core sample.
